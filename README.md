# _{Slimed}_

##### _{Hangman game, PHP OOP practice}, {August 2015}_

#### By _**{Jenna Maloney}**_

## Description

_{This web app will allow the user to play a simple game of Slimed, which is a revamp of the classic Hangman game. The spaces at the bottom each represent a letter, letters of which spell out a randomly selected word from a word bank hard-coded into the app. On the New Guess page, users input a letter. Then, if the input letter is also a letter in the selected word, any previously empty spaces representing that particular letter will now display that letter. The user gets 6 guesses to complete the word, but any correct guesses do not count against the amount of guesses remaining. Once the user inputs 6 correct guesses, they will have been slimed and the game is over.}_

## Setup

* _clone repository_
* _run $ composer install_
* _start localhost server in Terminal_
* _navigate to localhost in your browser_


## Technologies Used

_{HTML, Silex, Twig, composer, PHP}_
